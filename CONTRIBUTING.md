# Recommended steps for contributors

Contributors to `NuLattice` should follow the general steps of:
1. [Forking](https://github.com/NuLattice/NuLattice/fork) the repository;
2. Adding new developments, fixes, optimizations, or other contributions in a new branch (not `main`);
3. And merging their contributions back to the main repository via a [pull request](https://github.com/NuLattice/NuLattice/pulls).

Below we provide instructions on how contributors can do this step by step, including instructions on making new developments private until they are ready to be made public and merged back into the main repository.

## Forking the repository

To fork `NuLattice`, simply click the button on the top right of [the main repository page](https://github.com/NuLattice/NuLattice):

![Forking NuLattice](contributing/forking.png "How to fork NuLattice")

The button is highlighted in red. This creates a new repository forked from `NuLattice` at the url `https://github.com/[your Github username]/NuLattice`. You can modify the fork however you like, including adding collaborators, and you will use the fork to contribute your developments and improvements back to `NuLattice` once they are ready (see below).
